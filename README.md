Cosmodrome is built for developers who routinely run Claude Code, Aider, Codex, or Gemini across multiple projects. Instead of juggling terminal tabs and windows, Cosmodrome organizes terminals by project with a shared GPU-rendered view, detects what each AI agent is doing in real time, and surfaces the information that matters: which agents need your input, which are working, and which hit errors.

Built with Swift, AppKit, and Metal. No Electron. No Tauri. No tmux wrapper.

## Features

### Activity Log -- "What happened while I was away"

The hero feature. A full-screen overlay (`Cmd+L`) showing a structured timeline of everything your agents did: files changed, commands run, errors encountered, cost per task. Sessions are grouped and collapsible, sorted by most recent activity. Filter by time window (last hour, today, all), by event type (files, commands, errors), or by session.

Come back from lunch, open the Activity Log, and see exactly what 5 agents accomplished while you were gone.

### Fleet Overview

Full-screen dashboard (`Cmd+Shift+F`) showing all agents across all projects. Agent cards sorted by priority (needs input first, then errors, then working, then idle). Filter by state. Aggregate stats: total cost, tasks completed, files changed.

### GPU-Accelerated Rendering

A single Metal `MTKView` renders all visible terminal sessions via viewport scissoring. Shared glyph atlas, triple-buffered vertex data, no per-frame allocations. Sub-4ms frame times.

### Project-First Organization

Group terminals by project, not by tab order. Each project defines its sessions in a `cosmodrome.yml` file: dev servers, databases, AI agents -- all launched and managed together.

### AI Agent State Detection

Cosmodrome automatically detects Claude Code, Aider, Codex, and Gemini sessions and reports their state:

| State | Indicator | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Working | Green | Agent is thinking, streaming, or executing tools |
| Needs Input | Yellow | Agent is waiting for approval or a response |
| Error | Red | Something failed |
| Inactive | -- | Idle or not an agent session |

### Cost Tracking

Per-session and per-task cost tracking with fleet-wide aggregation. See how much each agent is spending, average cost per task, and total fleet cost. Cost history with sparkline visualization.

### Claude Code Hooks Integration

Deep integration with Claude Code via structured hooks. Cosmodrome receives real-time JSON events for every tool use (file reads, writes, commands, subagent spawns) with structured data extraction: file paths, exit codes, cost deltas. Hook events are authoritative -- when available, they supersede regex-based state detection.

### Model Detection

Detects which LLM model each agent is using (Opus, Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.) and displays it in the status bar.

### Completion Actions

When an agent finishes a task, Cosmodrome suggests next steps -- "Open diff", "Run tests", "Start review agent" -- without ever auto-triggering them.

### Session Recording

Record terminal sessions in asciicast v2 format for playback and sharing.

### MCP Server

JSON-RPC 2.0 server over stdio for programmatic observation: list projects, query agent states, read terminal content, get fleet stats, get activity log.

### CLI Control Plane

`cosmoctl` provides command-line access to a running Cosmodrome instance via Unix socket.

### Additional Features

- **Command palette** (`Cmd+P`) for quick access to all actions
- **Modal keybindings** with vim-style command mode (`Ctrl+Space`)
- **Theme system** with dark, light, and custom YAML themes
- **OSC 133 semantic prompt tracking** for shell integration
- **Session persistence** with scrollback restoration across restarts
- **Native macOS notifications** for agent state changes
- **Grid and Focus layout modes** -- grid for overview, focus for deep work
- **Font zoom** (`Cmd+=`/`Cmd+-`) with persistence

### Philosophy

**Observe, never orchestrate.** Cosmodrome watches what your agents do and tells you what happened. It never sends input to agents, never auto-triggers actions, and never controls agent behavior. The developer is always in the loop.

## Claude Code Hooks Setup

To enable deep integration with Claude Code, add Cosmodrome's hook to your Claude Code configuration:

**`~/.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/Applications/Cosmodrome.app/Contents/MacOS/CosmodromeHook"
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/Applications/Cosmodrome.app/Contents/MacOS/CosmodromeHook"
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/Applications/Cosmodrome.app/Contents/MacOS/CosmodromeHook"
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/Applications/Cosmodrome.app/Contents/MacOS/CosmodromeHook"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With hooks enabled, Cosmodrome receives structured JSON events for every tool use, providing:
- Authoritative agent state detection (no regex guessing)
- File paths, commands, and exit codes from tool use
- Cost tracking from notification events
- Subagent spawn/completion tracking

---

## Configuration

### Project Configuration

Create a `cosmodrome.yml` in your project root:

```yaml
name: "My Project"
color: "#4A90D9"

sessions:
  - name: "Claude Code"
    command: "claude"
    agent: true
    auto_start: true

  - name: "Dev Server"
    command: "npm run dev"
    auto_start: true
    auto_restart: true
    restart_delay: 2

  - name: "Database"
    command: "docker compose up postgres"
    auto_start: true

  - name: "Shell"
    command: "zsh"

layout: grid
```

### User Configuration

Global settings live in `~/.config/cosmodrome/config.yml`:

```yaml
font:
  family: "SF Mono"
  size: 13

theme: dark

notifications:
  agent_needs_input: true
  agent_error: true
  agent_complete: false

scrollback_lines: 10000
```

### State Persistence

Application state (window position, open projects, session state, scrollback) is saved automatically to:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Cosmodrome/
```

---

## Architecture

Cosmodrome uses a minimal threading model: one main thread (UI + Metal rendering) and one I/O thread (kqueue-based PTY multiplexer + VT parsing + agent detection). No thread-per-session, no event bus, no Combine.

Key decisions:

- **Single MTKView** for all sessions (viewport scissoring, not N render loops)
- **kqueue multiplexer** for all PTY I/O (scales to 50+ sessions on one thread)
- **Agent detection inline on I/O** (pattern match when data arrives, no polling)
- **@Observable** for state propagation (direct mutation, no indirection)
- **SwiftTerm** for VT parsing now, **libghostty-vt** when its C API stabilizes
- **Hook events authoritative** when available, regex fallback otherwise

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## Performance

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Input latency | < 5ms keystroke to screen |
| Frame render | < 4ms per frame |
| Memory per session | < 10MB |
| Startup to interactive | < 200ms |
| CPU when idle | < 0.5% |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

Key guidelines:
- Profile before optimizing. Use Instruments, not guesswork.
- No new dependencies without justification. Currently: SwiftTerm, Yams. That's it.
- `final class` by default. `@Observable` for models. No force-unwrapping outside tests.
- Run `swift build` before submitting.
